An open-source tiny foundational model for single-channel EMG-based hand gesture recognition. 

## Abstact
Surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals play a critical role in developing intuitive and responsive Human–Computer Interfaces (HCI). Traditional multi-channel sEMG systems, while highly accurate, are often costly, power-intensive, and difficult to scale for commercial deployment. This study explores a machine learning-based approach for single-channel sEMG signal classification aimed at enabling cost-effective gesture recognition. The proposed system demonstrates the potential to simplify hardware design while maintaining robust performance, making it viable for large-scale integration in consumer-grade applications such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) controls, wearable devices, and prosthetic interfaces. By reducing sensor complexity and data processing requirements, this framework supports efficient resource allocation and manufacturing scalability. The findings highlight the commercial promise of lightweight sEMG solutions in creating affordable, adaptable, and user-centered assistive technologies for both industrial and healthcare sectors.
